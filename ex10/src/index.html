                        This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today,
                        but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always
                        easy.

                                    Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming.
                                    Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but
                                    programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce
                                    their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you
                                    might just get lost in it.

                                    In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this:<br>

                        Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.

                        Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

                                The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary. Creating new words in prose is usually bad style. But in programming, it is indispensable.

                        Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures.

                                The programs we have built so far have been limited by the fact that they were operating only on simple data types. This chapter will introduce basic data structures. By the end of it, you’ll know enough to start writing useful programs.

                                A large program is a costly program, and not just because of the time it takes to build. Size almost always involves complexity, and complexity confuses programmers. Confused programmers, in turn, introduce mistakes (bugs) into programs. A large program then provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide, making them hard to find.
